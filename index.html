    <p id="Brands">Our goal is to offer consumers the <span>best</span> experience possible while shopping online for clothes. In order to achieve this, we are looking for <span>brand partnerships</span> to offer the <span>easiest</span> and the <span>most accurate</span> sizing recommendations.</p>
    <p id="Technology">Bespoke takes its users measurements in a single photo and it will find the right size for every purchase. It is available in the form of a mobile application and an API. Clothing companies will be able to include the Bespoke API directly on their website.</p>

<p>Users will then take a single photo of themselves on the company's website and Bespoke will analyze it to provide the necessary measurements in order to give accurate sizing recommendations. Once a person has taken their measurements, they will be able to get sizing recommendations from every brand partnering with Bespoke simply by logging in with their email address.</p>

    <p>Using ARKit and internal AR development, Bespoke is able to precisely calculate the measurements necessary for clothes sizing in a fraction of a second. Instantly, the measurements data created in the API is transferred to clothing companies. This way, it will be easy to compare a person's measurements to clothing items in order to provide accurate sizing recommendations.</p>

    <div class="text">
    <h1>Our Impact</h1>
    
      <p id="a">Bespoke will greatly reduce the number of <span>returns</span> for clothing companies by eliminating the problem of sizing associated with the purchase of clothes online. Knowing that close to <span>40%</span> of online orders are returned<sup>1</sup>, Bespoke has the potential to create <span>substantial savings</span> for companies in the clothing industry.  </p>
      <p>A great illustration of this problem is the CEO of ASOS stating that a fall of only 1% in returns would immediately add $16 million to the company's bottom line<sup>2</sup>.</p>

    <p id="b">Bespoke can bring a <span>new customer base</span> to clothing companies that sell online because previously hesitant consumers <span>wouldn't have to worry</span> about sizing anymore. In addition, free returns make 54% of consumers more likely to shop online<sup>3</sup>. With Bespoke, companies will be able to offer this crucial service at a <span>fraction of the usual cost</span> since their returns will decrease significantly.</p>

    <p id="c">The decrease in returns will also create a decrease in transportation. This will allow companies to have a <span>less important impact on the environment</span>. Transportation being a leading cause of environmental problems, even a <span> slight decrease in returns</span> globally will have <span>tremendous effects</span> on our planet.</p>

    <h1>Potential Savings</h1>
